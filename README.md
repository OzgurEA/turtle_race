# turtle_race
Experience the thrill of the track as adorable turtles compete to be crowned the ultimate champion. This Python project, created with the Turtle graphics library, brings to life an exhilarating turtle race that will have you on the edge of your seat.
In this project:

Turtles are dynamically created with different colors and positions on the track.
Users can place bets on the winning turtle before the race begins.
The race unfolds with each turtle advancing a random distance at every iteration.
Witness the excitement as the first turtle crosses the finish line and see if your bet was a winner!
